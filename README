Node.js / jQuery / socket.io Chatroom

Meant to be simple and easy to get up and running/drop into a site (assuming you can run yout won node server)

In it's very early stages, but plan to add:
 - options for configuring layout size and colors.
 - sign on once via modal, change nichname via modal.
 - broadcast sender list only when neccesary
 - ban users via admin password
 - more color options / formatting for user dialoags 
 - general prettiness
 - color user list to match dialog
 - show count of users in room
